      <h2>/ˈseɪ.ri.ə/  (n.)</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Cy-Aeria, simply known as Cy 
            is a 22-year-old woman standing at the crossroads 
            between youthful curiosity and the responsibilities of adulthood.
            <br>
            <br>         
            Still learning how to navigate the world, she’s a fresh graduate 
            who's stepped into the ever-changing field of tech as a software developer. 
            When she’s not debugging lines of code, she’s keeping the beat on her drums, 
            sketching lines into her tablet, reading, or immersing herself in digital adventures 
            across games like Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail, and Wuthering Waves. 
            Her hands never stop moving, but her heart up until recently, rarely followed.
            <br>
            <br> 
            Cy didn’t mean to find STRXNGER. However, in her constant search for a pulse, she did.
            Through them, she found how it could feel like being. Like belonging. Like becoming.
            <br>
            <br> 
            On the night she skipped a tech seminar, she wandered into a dim bar 
            with a flickering amp and a rusted drum kit. The mic was broken, the setlist abandoned, 
            but someone was playing anyway. She didn’t introduce herself. She just picked up the 
            sticks and played until her fingers ached and someone across the room started to sing.
            No one asked who she was, where she was from, or what she did in life. 
            They only cared that she felt it — the tempo, the chaos, the silence between sounds.
            <br>
            <br> 
            In STRXNGER, Cy became The Fool to embody freedom, rebellion, and a new beginning, 
            a fresh start, and the courage to embrace the unknown.
            She is not a prodigy, and she never claimed to be. 
            She's just a dreamer. One who finally found a place where she could be herself, 
            and where she could create music that resonated with her soul. 
            A place where strangers didn’t stay strangers for long.

      <p style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 16px; padding-top: 20px;">Who's <strong>STRXNGER</strong>? </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 12px;">They didn't start with a dream. 
        They started with nothing, no money, no clear path, 
        no passion left for the kind of future people kept telling them to chase. 
        Some of them were running from things they never talked about. Others were 
        just trying to survive the weight of days that felt the same. They were strangers, 
        not only to each other, but to themselves. Tired hearts, restless hands, quiet minds 
        that once burned bright but had since dulled into silence. The kind of people 
        who used to believe in something, but now only believed in getting by. 
        <a style="text-decoration: none !important; font-style: italic;" href="https://www.facebook.com/strxnger.649706">See More...</a>
      </p>

      <!-- <p style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 12px;">They met by accident. Or maybe it wasn't. A broken mic in a corner bar, 
        a borrowed guitar on a rooftop, a half-finished song echoing in an empty hallway. 
        There was no grand formation, just sounds stitched together by instinct, emotion, 
        and a need to feel something. What started as a single jam session turned into another, 
        and another, until they realized they kept showing up not for the music, but for each other.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 12px;">They didn't know what to call it, so they chose a name that felt honest, STRXNGER. 
        A reminder of what they were when they began. Eight people from different places, 
        carrying stories they didn't always share, bonded not by success or skill, but by the way 
        their instruments made them feel less alone. Music didn't fix them, but it gave them somewhere 
        to place the hurt. Somewhere to start over. They never set out to change the world. 
        They just wanted to make noise loud enough to drown out the silence they'd lived in for too long. 
        And maybe, along the way, they'd figure out how to become something more than strangers.
